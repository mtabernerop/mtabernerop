### Hi there 👋

I'm Miguel from Spain, and I'm currently studying a Bachelor in Computer Science and Engineering at the University Carlos III (Madrid, Spain). I really enjoy learning about the major sub-fields of Artificial Intelligence including Machine Learning, Planning, Neural Networks and Evolutionary Computation. I also enjoy website development and overall, computer programming.
